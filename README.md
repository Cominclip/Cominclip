### Hi there 👋

- I’m a second-year master student at [IIGROUP](https://sites.google.com/view/iigroup-thu/home) in [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=4gH3sxsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works).
- I'm now a research intern at [ByteDance Seed](https://team.doubao.com/en/direction/multimodal), focusing on Multimodal Post-Training.
- I worked closely with Dr. [Ling Yang](https://yangling0818.github.io/) and Prof. [Mengdi Wang](https://mwang.princeton.edu/) from the AI Lab at Princeton University.
- My research interests lie in Reinforcement Learning and Unified Multimodal Models.
